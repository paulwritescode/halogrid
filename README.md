# Animated Gradient Box

This project demonstrates a visually appealing animated gradient border effect using only CSS. When you hover over the box, a conic-gradient border animates around it, creating a glowing, colorful effect. The animation leverages modern CSS features such as custom properties (`@property`), conic gradients, and keyframe animations.

## Features

- **Animated Gradient Border:** The border animates smoothly around the box on hover.
- **Pure CSS:** No JavaScript required.
- **Modern CSS Techniques:** Uses CSS custom properties, conic gradients, and the `@property` rule.
- **Responsive Centering:** The box is centered both vertically and horizontally on the page.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open the `halo.html` file in your browser.
3. Hover over the box to see the animated gradient effect.

## Browser Support

This demo uses experimental CSS features (`@property` and animating custom properties), which are best supported in Chromium-based browsers (like Chrome and Edge). Support in Firefox and Safari may be limited.
